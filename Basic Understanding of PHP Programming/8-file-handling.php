<!-- File handling in PHP is a fundamental skill that allows you to read and write files, making your scripts more powerful and versatile. Here's how to get started with file handling in PHP: -->

<?php

// Reading Files:

// To read the contents of a file, you'll typically follow these steps:

// 1. Open the File: Use the fopen() function to open the file. This function takes two arguments: the filename and the mode ("r" for reading).

// $file = fopen("text.txt", "r");





// 2. Read the File: Use functions like fgets(), fread(), or file() to read the content. For example, using fgets():
// $content = fgets($file);






// 3. Close the File: Don't forget to close the file using fclose().
// $fclose($file);
